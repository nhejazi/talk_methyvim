  \note{This slide deck is for a brief (about 15-minute) talk on a new
    statistical algorithm for using nonparametric and data-adaptive estimates of
    variable importance measures for differential methylation analysis. This
    talk was most recently given at the annual retreat of the
    \href{http://ccb.berkeley.edu/}{Center for
    Computational Biology} at the University of California, Berkeley.

  It's always good to start with a
  motivating example. Excerpts from
  famous studies/papers or personal
  communications usually do nicely.

  It's also good practice to keep
  things like this rather short.
